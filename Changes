	- Updated the INSTALL file

0.02  Thu Jan 16 02:18:21 1997
	- Made a semi-questionable fix to correct the output of keys,
	  where the same key in multiple overlayed hashes would be listed
	  multiple times. And DELETE() was modified to delete instances
	  of a key in all overlayed hashes. Documentation was changed
	  accordingly.

	- Scrapped test.pl, added a t/ directory, created minimal tests.

0.02  Wed Jan 15 19:39:56 1997
	- Added a new() function to Tie::Hash::Overlay, which allowed
	  me to change overlay() from a static constructor to a function
	  that pushes hashes to be overlayed in a stack-like way.
	  Documentation changed accordingly.
