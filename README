Welcome to the Tie::Hash::Overlay README file. :)

The basic idea for this module is simple enough. Whenever a hash is
accessed, search through a list of other hashes and see if the key is in
any of them. If it is, access that hash. Otherwise, access a fall-through
hash that ensures that no accesses fail.

Of course, there's a bit more to it than that. But the above description
should be enough for now. This module is used in my Inheritance module,
and that would be good place to look to see how to put this to good use.

If you find a bug, have a question or comment, or just want to make a
recommendation, feel free send me an e-mail at jql@accessone.com.
